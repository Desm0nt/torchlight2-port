# Diablo III Mobile

**A native Android port of Diablo III: Eternal Collection for Nintendo Switch.** The game's own AArch64 program runs
directly on the phone's CPU; a small host provides the Switch system services (HLE of the `nn::` SDK), and the NVN
graphics API is replayed on Vulkan. You bring the game: this repository contains no game content and no keys.

Русский: [ниже](#по-русски).

**Install:** step-by-step guide for players — [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) (English) ·
[docs/INSTALL.ru.md](docs/INSTALL.ru.md) (по-русски). In short: dump your own game + update v1441792 (and, if you want
another language, its language-pack DLC) and `prod.keys`, put them into `put-game-files-here/`, double-click `setup.bat`
(or `bash setup.sh`), copy `work/Diablo3Mobile` to the phone's `Download` folder and install the APK (build it with
`build.bat`, see *Building*).

> [!WARNING]
> **Tested so far on one device: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / Adreno 750 (Xiaomi 14 Ultra) with the bundled Mesa Turnip driver.**
> **Devices with Mali (Exynos, Dimensity, Tensor), PowerVR and Xclipse GPUs have not been tested at all** — the engine has
> fallbacks for them, but expect problems. If something goes wrong on your device, please
> [open an issue](https://github.com/Desm0nt/diablo3-port/issues) and **always attach the logs**: the whole folder
> `Download/Diablo3Mobile/logs/` — `crash.txt` (written at the start after a crash), `boot.log` / `boot.prev.log` and
> `logcat.txt` / `logcat.prev.txt` (written live, so they survive even when the system kills the game) — and name your
> phone model and Android version. Without logs a report usually can't be acted on.

## Screenshots

Captured on the phone (Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Adreno 750, Mesa Turnip 27) with the widescreen option on: the game renders
2000×900 at the screen's 20:9 shape (wider view, nothing stretched; loading screens are stretched to fill the screen).
The counter in the top-left corner is the port's own FPS / frame time / GPU time overlay (it can be turned off). Game
text in Russian from the language-pack DLC; on-screen controls in the touch-friendly gamepad layout.

## What it is, and what it is not

**It is:**

- The original game code, **executing natively** on the phone — no emulated CPU, no JIT. Switch and Android phones
  share the AArch64 instruction set; an offline rewriter (`dm/tools/patch_nso.py`) changes only the few instructions
  that cannot run unchanged on Linux (x18 use, TLS reads, system calls, counter reads) into calls to the host, and
  `dm/verify/equiv.py` checks every rewritten site against the original instruction before you play.
- An HLE host for the Horizon OS services Diablo III uses (SDK **8.2.0**: threads, memory with the VAMM address space,
  file system, audio renderer, input, account, add-on content…), and an NVN (**API version 53**) → Vulkan recorder and
  engine tuned for Adreno GPUs. The game's shaders are taken from its CPK archives and translated to SPIR-V offline on
  your PC.
- A phone port: touch controls designed for Diablo (floating move stick, touch-to-walk, skill buttons with the game's
  own skill icons, menu gestures), game controllers, an optional **widescreen (Hor+)** mode, sharpening, a 30 / 60 fps
  limit, rumble, and the game's own languages through its language-pack DLC.

**It is not:**

- An emulator, cloud gaming or streaming.
- **A source of game content.** There is no game program, data, shader, text, art or key in this repository, and the
  APK contains none. You dump the game from a Switch you own and convert it on your PC
  ([docs/d3/GAME_FILES.md](docs/d3/GAME_FILES.md)). What the repository knows about the game (patch addresses, structure
  offsets, format descriptions…) is listed in [docs/d3/DERIVED.md](docs/d3/DERIVED.md).
- Online. Battle.net, local wireless, amiibo and the shop answer like a console without a connection; the game takes its
  offline branch (single player, local saves).
- Affiliated with Blizzard Entertainment or Nintendo.

## Current state

Tested on **Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / Adreno 750** (Xiaomi 14 Ultra) with Mesa Turnip v27.

- Boot, the AUTOSAVE notice, the title screen, the main menu, hero creation and **Act 1 gameplay run at 60 fps** (the
  game's own cap, as on the Switch); GPU time is about 10–11 ms per frame in Act 1 at the docked resolution.
- Output: the Switch's **docked 1600×900** (or handheld 1280×720) render, shown as 16:9 with bars, stretched, or —
  with the **widescreen** option — rendered in the screen's own shape (e.g. 2000×900 on a 20:9 phone) with a wider view at
  the sides (Hor+), the HUD at the screen edges and the loading screens stretched to fit.
- Input: a touch layout made for Diablo (left stick appears under the thumb, touch-and-hold the world to walk there,
  double-tap to evade, skill buttons A / B / X / Y / R / ZR, L = potion, a MENU mode with swipe / tap gestures for the
  console menus), a Joy-Con-like gamepad layout, Bluetooth / USB controllers, rumble. Positions, size and opacity of the
  on-screen controls can be edited.
- Unified front end (shared with the DOOM Mobile port): a pause menu that really holds the game, gamepad skins
  (nx2android's theme packs) and a layout editor, save export / import, live docked / handheld switching.
- Port settings (gear button): menu and game language, game resolution (docked / handheld), picture shape (bars /
  stretched / widescreen), stretched loading screens, FSR RCAS sharpening, frame rate limit (30 / 60), Vulkan driver,
  vibration, FPS counter, stick dead-zone compensation, control layout and editing, skill icons on buttons, the gear
  button's look.
- Languages: English out of the box; other languages (e.g. Russian, index 10) need the game's language-pack DLC, which
  setup extracts when you put it next to the game files.

### Known issues

- Only update **v1441792** (game patch 2.7.7) is supported; the patches and addresses are tied to its build id
  (`main` 2607a74f…, `sdk` 3ae34e68…).
- Only one device has been tested; other Snapdragon devices may work, other GPUs (Mali, PowerVR, Xclipse) are untested
  (the engine has fallbacks for them, see *Other GPUs*).
- The offline game cannot use online features (seasons, clans, Battle.net co-op).
- Long sessions (heat, memory) and the later acts have seen less testing than Act 1. Reports are welcome.
- Many renderer and host fixes are still behind switches for A/B testing (`Download/Diablo3Mobile/dm/env`); see
  [docs/d3/](docs/d3/).

## Building

Requirements: Android SDK with NDK r29 (29.0.14206865), CMake ≥ 3.22 and Ninja, JDK 17+ and Gradle, Python 3. Clone
with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recursive <this repository>
# or, in an existing clone:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Configure the native host for Diablo III (`DM_GAME=d3`; the default `d2r` builds the original D2R host):

```sh
cmake -S dm/android -B work/build-android -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
  -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-31 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDM_GAME=d3
```

Then build, sign and (optionally) install the APK — `build.bat` on Windows (wraps the PowerShell script), `pwsh`
elsewhere:

```sh
build.bat [-Install <adb serial>]                 # Windows
pwsh tools/build_apk.ps1 [-Install <adb serial>]  # Linux / macOS with PowerShell
```

The script reads every tool path from the environment (`ANDROID_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME`, `GRADLE`, `PYTHON`) and signs with
`DM_KEYSTORE` (default: the Android debug keystore in `~/.android`). Output: `work/D3-port-debug.apk`, app id
`org.diablo3.port` ("Diablo III Mobile"). It downloads the default Turnip driver with a pinned SHA-256
(`tools/fetch_turnip.py`) the first time. `work/` is git-ignored and holds every build output and every game-derived file.

## Installing

Full guide: **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)** (English) / **[docs/INSTALL.ru.md](docs/INSTALL.ru.md)** (Russian).

1. Dump your own copy (base game `01001B300B9BE000` + update `01001B300B9BE800` **v1441792**, as NSP / NSZ / XCI / XCZ;
   optional language packs, e.g. Russian `01001B300B9BF00A`) and your console's `prod.keys` — e.g. with nxdumptool and
   Lockpick_RCM on your Switch.
2. Put the files into `put-game-files-here/` (any names) and double-click `setup.bat`, or run `bash setup.sh` on
   Linux / macOS (explicit files in any order work too; `setup check` reports what is missing and changes nothing).
   Setup provides Python, its packages and the .NET 10 SDK in `tools/.runtime` when they are missing (it asks first),
   checks the inputs and the free space (~20 GB while preparing, more with NSZ / XCZ or language packs), then extracts the
   program, patches it, checks the patch, extracts the data, translates the shaders and extracts the language packs into
   `work/Diablo3Mobile` (~16 GB, +5–6 GB per language pack). Technical details: [docs/d3/GAME_FILES.md](docs/d3/GAME_FILES.md).
3. Copy `work/Diablo3Mobile` to the phone's `Download` folder (USB cable, *File transfer* mode, or `setup push` /
   the adb commands setup prints) and install the APK.
4. Start *Diablo III Mobile* and allow *All files access* when asked.

## Vulkan drivers

The APK bundles **Mesa Turnip v27** (an adrenotools build of Mesa main for Adreno 6xx/7xx) and uses it by default; it
falls back to the phone's own driver when Turnip does not load or finds no supported GPU. Your own adrenotools driver
package can be copied into `Download/Diablo3Mobile/drivers/` (the folder or the package zip as released) and chosen in the
gear dialog. Details and known packages: [drivers/README.md](drivers/README.md).

The default is picked per GPU at every start (from the DOOM 2016 port): Adreno 6xx/7xx use the bundled Turnip;
Adreno 710/720/722 and 8xx use their own Turnip package, which the app downloads when the phone is online (the list is
DOOM Mobile's public [drivers/manifest.json](https://github.com/Desm0nt/doom-port/blob/main/drivers/manifest.json),
each zip checked against its SHA-256); Mali, PowerVR, Xclipse and anything without the Adreno kernel driver use the
phone's own driver, and Turnip packages are hidden there. A package for another GPU family, a Linux/glibc build
(`*-EMULATOR.zip`) or one missing a library is not loaded and is hidden in the gear dialog with the reason. After loading,
the app checks that the package's driver really took over; if not, or if it fails to start, the game runs on the system
driver and a message says why. If two launches in a row end before the first frame with a custom driver, the system
driver is chosen and saved (crash guard).

## Other GPUs (Mali, PowerVR, Xclipse)

Untested on real hardware. The engine checks the device's features and, instead of aborting, falls back where the
game's Switch shaders need something the GPU lacks (all ported from the DOOM 2016 port): no geometry shaders, no
format-less storage writes or `shaderImageGatherExtended` (those shaders are skipped or degraded), no D24 depth (D32
is used), no GPU timestamps, no linear filtering of some formats (nearest), no depth bounds / non-solid fill / depth bias
clamp, no `nullDescriptor`, texel buffer limits, driver pipeline failures (skipped instead of fatal), interrupted fence
waits on Mali. BC textures, which Mali and PowerVR cannot sample, are decoded on the GPU in batches. One boot.log line
lists what the device needed: `NVN fallbacks on this device: ...`. `DM_GFX_SIM_GPU=mali` (or `powervr`, `xclipse`) in
`Download/Diablo3Mobile/dm/env` simulates such a GPU on a Snapdragon for testing. Reports (device, GPU, driver,
`crash.txt`) are very welcome.

## Android versions and CPUs

- `D3-port-debug.apk`: Android 12 or newer (minSdk 31). `D3-port-debug-android10.apk` (`build_apk.ps1 -Android10`): the
  same app for Android 10 and 11 (minSdk 29; asks for the storage permission there instead of *All files access*); it
  also installs on newer Android. Not yet tested on a real Android 10 / 11 device.
- 64-bit ARM only. ARMv8.0 CPUs without LSE atomics (Cortex-A53 / A57 / A72 / A73 phones, e.g. Snapdragon 6xx) are
  supported: the port's own hand-written code picks an ARMv8.0 variant at start (`boot: cpu ...` line in boot.log).

## Logs and crash reports

Every start writes a fresh `boot.log` (the previous run is kept as `boot.prev.log`): the device, SoC, GPU, Vulkan driver
choice, CPU features and the game's progress (archives opened, loading screens, menus, Vulkan driver status). When the
game crashes or is killed while playing, the next start writes **`Download/Diablo3Mobile/logs/crash.txt`** (the previous
one is kept as `crash.prev.txt`; without file access `Android/data/org.diablo3.port/files/logs/`) and shows a message:
the device header, the reason, the start and end of that run's boot.log and the app's logcat. `boot.log` itself is
copied next to it when the app goes to the background. Attach `crash.txt` to a bug report. Switches and details:
[docs/d3/DOOM_PORTS.md](docs/d3/DOOM_PORTS.md).

## Repository layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `dm/` | The host (from d2r-mobile, via DOOM Mobile): loader, HLE (`dm/host`, Diablo III code in `hle_d3.c` / `hle_d3_ui.c` and behind `DM_GAME_D3`), NVN recorder and Vulkan engine (`dm/gfx`), Android app (`dm/android`), offline rewriter (`dm/tools/patch_nso.py`) and its verifiers (`dm/verify`). The tree also carries the DOOM, DOOM Eternal and Xenoblade 2 code paths of the same host family (`DM_GAME=doom / eternal / xc2`); Diablo III builds on the lean DOOM core and reuses the XC2 shader translator. |
| `setup.sh`, `setup.bat`, `build.bat` | Game file preparation (`tools/setup_d3.py`) and APK build entry points |
| `tools/` | Diablo III tooling: package / RomFS / ExeFS readers, CPK archive reader, shader jobs and translation, DLC extraction, APK build, device test and analysis scripts |
| `third_party/libadrenotools` | git submodule (BSD-2-Clause) |
| `drivers/` | Notes on the bundled and optional Vulkan driver packages (no binaries) |
| `docs/d3/` | Port documentation: journal, CPK format, shaders, build gates, widescreen, touch design, performance notes, game files, derived information |
| `docs/THIRD_PARTY.md`, `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`, `docs/DERIVED.md`, `docs/upstream/` | Attribution: code ported from other projects, the third-party code and D2R-derived records inherited from d2r-mobile, and d2r-mobile's acknowledgements |

**Diablo III Mobile** — нативный порт Diablo III: Eternal Collection для Nintendo Switch на Android. Оригинальный
AArch64-код игры исполняется прямо на процессоре телефона (без эмулятора и JIT); небольшой хост подменяет системные
сервисы Switch (HLE `nn::`, SDK 8.2), а графический API NVN (API 53) воспроизводится через Vulkan. Основа — проект
[d2r-mobile](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/d2r-mobile) (MIT) через порт DOOM Mobile.

- **Игры в репозитории нет.** Нужна своя копия Diablo III для Switch (база + обновление v1441792, по желанию — языковой
  пакет DLC, например русский `01001B300B9BF00A`) и свои ключи консоли. **Установка по шагам:
  [docs/INSTALL.ru.md](docs/INSTALL.ru.md).** Технические подробности подготовки файлов —
  [docs/d3/GAME_FILES.md](docs/d3/GAME_FILES.md) (англ.), журнал порта — [docs/d3/D3_PORT.md](docs/d3/D3_PORT.md).
- Проверено на одном устройстве: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / Adreno 750 (Xiaomi 14 Ultra) с драйвером Turnip из APK: меню и
  геймплей Акта 1 — **60 fps**. Другие GPU не проверялись; для Mali / PowerVR / Xclipse в движке есть фолбэки из порта
  DOOM 2016 (без геометрических шейдеров, без D24, без BC — декод текстур на GPU и т. п.; строка
  `NVN fallbacks on this device` в boot.log).
- Драйвер выбирается по GPU при каждом запуске: Adreno 6xx/7xx — встроенный Turnip, Adreno 710/720/722 и 8xx — свой
  пакет Turnip (скачивается, когда есть интернет, с проверкой SHA-256), Mali / PowerVR / Xclipse — системный. Пакет не
  для этого GPU, glibc-сборка или пакет без нужной библиотеки не загружаются и скрыты в настройках с причиной; если
  выбранный драйвер не подменил системный или не запустился — игра идёт на системном и показывает почему; два запуска
  подряд без первого кадра — системный драйвер сохраняется.
- Android 12+: `D3-port-debug.apk` (minSdk 31); Android 10 и 11: `D3-port-debug-android10.apk` (minSdk 29,
  `build_apk.ps1 -Android10`; на настоящем Android 10 ещё не проверялся). Процессоры ARMv8.0 без LSE (Cortex-A53/A73,
  Snapdragon 6xx) поддерживаются.
- **Логи и отчёты о падении:** каждый запуск пишет новый `boot.log` (прошлый — `boot.prev.log`). После падения или
  убийства во время игры следующий запуск пишет **`Download/Diablo3Mobile/logs/crash.txt`** (прошлый — `crash.prev.txt`)
  и показывает сообщение; там же копия `boot.log`. Прикладывайте `crash.txt` к сообщениям об ошибках.
- Широкий экран (Hor+, по форме экрана телефона), сенсорная раскладка под Diablo (плавающий стик, ходьба по касанию,
  кнопки навыков с иконками из HUD игры, жесты для меню), геймпады, вибрация, резкость RCAS, лимит 30 / 60 fps,
  единое меню паузы, скины геймпада, перенос сохранений.
- Подготовка файлов: положите базу, обновление, `prod.keys` (и языковой пакет) в `put-game-files-here/` и дважды
  щёлкните `setup.bat` (Linux / macOS: `bash setup.sh`); проверка без изменений — `setup check`. Готовую папку
  `work/Diablo3Mobile` скопируйте в `Download` телефона (или `setup push`).
- Сборка: `cmake -S dm/android -B work/build-android … -DDM_GAME=d3`, затем `build.bat` / `tools/build_apk.ps1` (см. «Building»).
